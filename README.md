# ebook-reader-compare

A web application to compare the best ebook readers based on current market trends, features, and user needs. Inspired by the latest industry analysis of top devices like Kindle Scribe, Boox Go, and Kobo Libra.

## Features

- **Side-by-side comparison** of top ebook readers (Kindle Scribe, Boox Go, Kobo Libra, Onyx Palma)
- **Dynamic filtering** by key features:
  - Display type (E Ink vs LCD)
  - Size (Pocketable vs Large)

2. Showing **price vs feature tradeoffs** (e.g., front light vs budget model)
3. Including **recent launches** (2023 models from the trending article)
